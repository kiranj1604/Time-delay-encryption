# Time-delay-encryption
A system to encrypt a message such that it cannot be decrypted by anyone, not even the sender, before a specific amount of time has passed. This is achieved using a "time-lock puzzle," a computation that provably takes a certain amount of time to solve. This is a foundational concept for Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs).
